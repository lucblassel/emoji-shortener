# Emoji URL shortener

Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq5yubc1u18) by [Coding Garden with CJ](https://coding.garden).  
ALso got good info on express from [The Net Ninja](https://www.thenetninja.co.uk).  

I am going to try and deploy this more as a proof of concept rather than an actual working product because I don't 
want to go through the hassle of verifying if a given URL is a scam or phishing or whatever. 

If you have any comments or suggestions don't hesitate!
